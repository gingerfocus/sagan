// Monica, Chandler and Joey are hosting a party. There are currently N guests
// at the party. Each guest was given a placard with a number as they arrived.
// Monica being the organizer that she is, arranged all the guests analogous to
// a binary search tree with each of its nodes as a guest holding a placard.
// There are still M more guests to come. As one of the M guests arrive, they
// choose an arbitrary integer X, and they wish to be seated with a guest who
// has number X on their placard. Joey who is acting as a gatekeeper either
// lets a guest in if a guest with X on their placard exists in the party or
// sends the guest away if no one in the party has X on their placard. Every
// time, Joey asks Chandler to go look for the guest with X on their placard
// and shout YES or NO. Write a C++ program that helps Chandler to look for the
// guest in the most efficient way possible.
// Possible Input:
// ```
// 45 27 14 23 48 46 52 50
// 9 11 45 14 23 34
// ````
// Possible Output:
// ```
// No No Yes Yes Yes No
// ```
// First line of input contains the numbers on placards of N guests in the
// party. Second line of input represents the numbers that the M guests have
// picked. Here N is 8 and M is 6. Output is the corresponding Yes or No for
// each input of M.
